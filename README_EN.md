> **Version:** v2.1 | **Status:** Beta | **Darwin Score:** 84.3/100

Smart-Pick is a **fully generic, domain-agnostic** decision-making assistant. Whether you're comparing products, insurance plans, project bids, college applications, or life plans — if you have multiple options to weigh, Smart-Pick helps you make a structured, explainable choice.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dynamic Weights** | Generates weights per session based on scenario features (risk, capital, expertise needs) + user preference history. No hardcoded weights. |
| **OCR Integration** | Built-in PaddleOCR pipeline — extract text from screenshots, insurance policies, and documents automatically |
| **Real-time Price Comparison** | OpenCLI smzdm adapter pulls live prices from JD, PDD, Tmall, Douyin — no login required |
| **Layered Questioning** | Asks 2 critical questions first, then optional follow-ups — never overwhelms the user |
| **Proactive External Search** | Automatically detects when better options may exist, asks before searching |
| **Feedback Learning** | Records user choices over time, adjusts preference vectors — gets smarter with use |
| **Transparent & Intervenable** | All recommendations come with scored comparison tables; user can override weights at any time |
